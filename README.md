# Simple Portfolio app

This the source code of my portfolio. The data.json file has all the material and used variables and could easily be turned into a database.
This was done after finishing chapter 2 of [Full Stack Open 2019](https://fullstackopen.com/), an Open University course on FullStack React.js development.
The database will be added after the subsequent chapters discussing Redux and databases.

### This was made using React.js because:
* Because I want to learn more React
* It's nice and fast
* The site required heavy javascript for most animations and other fun stuff
* For the possibility of adding a database in the future
